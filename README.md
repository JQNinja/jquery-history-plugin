### jQuery History Plugin
### Fork

jQuery history plugin helps you to support back/forward buttons and bookmarks in your javascript applications.
You can store the application state into URL hash and restore the state from it. This fork (hopefully) will work with jQuery 1.10.*

### Supported Browsers

- Internet Explorer 8+
- Safari
- Chrome

This plugin is built on hashchange event, which is defined in HTML5 and supported in most modern browsers.
Unless it is supported the plugin works on some fallback mechanisms:

- iframe and setInterval (IE8 compatibility mode)
